            <p class="text-lg mb-6">Clarence Bowls Club has a rich and storied history, dating back over a century. Founded in 1912, the club has been a cornerstone of the local sporting community for generations.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Early Years</h2>
            <p>The club was established by a group of local enthusiasts who secured a lease on the current site. The first green was opened in 1913, and the original timber clubhouse was built shortly after. In those early days, the club served as a vital social hub for the town.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Growth and Development</h2>
            <p>Over the decades, the club expanded its facilities. A second green was added in the 1950s to accommodate a growing membership. The current modern clubhouse was completed in 1985, providing improved amenities and social space.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Success on the Green</h2>
            <p>Clarence has a proud record of success in regional and national competitions. Many of our members have gone on to represent the county, and our teams have won numerous league titles and cups over the years.</p>
